# Security Overview

The Aegis Kubernetes Framework implements a comprehensive security posture based on the principles of **Secure by Default**, **Zero Trust**, and **Defense in Depth**.

## Security Principles

### Secure by Default
- All components configured with security best practices
- Minimal attack surface
- Least privilege access
- Automated security controls

### Zero Trust
- No implicit trust between services
- Mutual TLS authentication
- Continuous verification
- Micro-segmentation

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple security layers
- Redundant controls
- Fail-safe mechanisms
- Comprehensive monitoring

## Security Components

### Network Security

#### Istio Service Mesh
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: All service-to-service communication encrypted and authenticated
- **Authorization Policies**: Fine-grained access control between services
- **Peer Authentication**: Enforces mTLS at the workload level
- **Request Authentication**: JWT validation for external requests

#### Network Policies
- **Namespace Isolation**: Traffic between namespaces blocked by default
- **Pod-level Controls**: Granular ingress/egress rules
- **External Access**: Controlled through gateways only

### Container Security

#### Image Security
- **Signature Validation**: All images must be signed with Cosign
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Trivy scans for CVEs and secrets
- **Base Image Validation**: Only approved base images allowed
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for supply chain security

#### Runtime Security
- **Pod Security Standards**: Enforced via Kyverno policies
- **Non-root Execution**: All containers run as non-root users
- **Read-only Filesystems**: Root filesystem mounted read-only
- **Privilege Escalation**: Disabled for all containers

### Infrastructure Security

#### AWS Security (Enhanced)
- **VPC Isolation**: Private subnets for worker nodes with proper dependency management
- **Security Groups**: Minimal required access with consistent tagging
- **IAM Roles**: **Critical Fix - Custom least-privilege policies replacing AdministratorAccess**
- **Encryption**: S3 buckets encrypted with comprehensive access controls
- **Input Validation**: All Terraform variables validated with regex and type checking
- **Resource Tagging**: Consistent tagging strategy across all infrastructure components

#### Kubernetes Security
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control enabled
- **Pod Security Admission**: Enforces security contexts
- **API Server Security**: TLS encryption and authentication
- **etcd Encryption**: Secrets encrypted at rest

### Identity and Access Management

### Network Policy Security (Enhanced)
- **Default Deny Policies**: All namespaces require explicit network policies
- **DNS Access Control**: Controlled DNS resolution for pods
- **API Server Access**: Restricted communication to Kubernetes API
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Istio policies complement network policies

### etcd Security (Enhanced)
- **etcd Encryption Validation**: Kyverno policies ensure encryption is enabled
- **etcd Access Restrictions**: Prevent direct etcd access from non-system pods
- **etcd Pod Security**: Non-root execution and privilege escalation prevention
